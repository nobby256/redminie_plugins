h2. Redmine users XLS import/export

* Plugin allows import and export of user data to/from XLS file.
* Plugin relies on gem spreadsheet for XLS based operations. Please install this gem before running plugin.
* Plugin adds two links - 'import' and 'export' to the users admin page (/redmine/users)
* Plugin patches *users\index.html.erb* view. Additions are marked with _VVK start_ and _VVK end_ comments
* Plugin uses column *'I'* to check if this entry should be imported.

Please note that this plugin is for *advanced users only* who understand how users model works in Redmine. I will provide only *limited support* for this plugin.
