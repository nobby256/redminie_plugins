## Unread issues

#### Plugin for Redmine

The plugin implements a convenient functionality of monitoring changes in issues.

In the list of issues appears colored indicators that show the current status of the issue.
If the issue is new and you have not viewed it yet, a green circle will lights before the title of the issue.
If the issue had any changes since your last view, a blue circle will lights before the title of the issue.

Plugin removes useless menu-item "Home" in main menu and renames menu-item "My page" to "My issues".
Also plugin implements the counter in the main menu next to menu-item "My issues".
The counter consists of three values:
* 1) Shows the number of issues, assigned to you.
* 2) Shows the number of new issues, assigned to the you, that you have not viewed yet.
* 3) Shows the number of issues, assigned to you, which had changes since last view.
